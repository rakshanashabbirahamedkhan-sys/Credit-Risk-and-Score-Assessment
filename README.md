# Credit Risk & Credit Score Assessment using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based credit risk assessment system using the UCI Credit Card dataset. The model predicts the probability of customer default and converts it into a credit score to categorize customers into risk levels.

## 📊 Dataset
- UCI Credit Card Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Target Variable: `default.payment.next.month`
- The dataset is included in this repository as a ZIP file

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

## 🔢 Credit Score Logic
Credit Score is calculated using: 
Credit Score = (1 - Probability of Default) × 850
